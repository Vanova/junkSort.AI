# dumpster-fire: an image recognition application for social good

## About the Contributors

Juliette, Julie, and Isabella are a part of the McGill Office of Innovation's [AI for Social Good Summer Lab](https://www.mcgill-innovation.com/ai-summer-lab). This program entails a two week crash course in machine learning and a two week project development phase for members of the lab. 

## About the Project

Given that the program has a fundamental principle of social good, the idea for this project percolated from an interest in promoting sustainability. **More to add when more is developed**

### Phases of the Project

- [ ] PART 1: Image recognition
	- [x] API design choice --> TensorFlow, Inception
	- [x] Minimum viable product - retrain neural net
	- [ ] Optimizing model to recognize more objects and with higher accuracy
- [x] PART 2: Categorisation
	- [x] Write code for layer between labeling and output to categorize objects as recyclable, compostable, or trash
	- [x] Develop item lists to use for categorisation
- [x] PART 3: App Design
	- [x] Decide on operating system --> Android
	- [x] Test on device for minimum viable product  --> Works but classification is weak
	- [x] Improve on User Interface design
- [ ] PART 4: Wrap up and presentation
	- [x] Create presentation template
	- [ ] Fill in content
	- [ ] Practice presentation
