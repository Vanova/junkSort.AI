# dumpster-fire: an image recognition application for social good

## About the Contributors

Juliette, Julie, and Isabella are a part of the McGill Office of Innovation's [AI for Social Good Summer Lab](https://www.mcgill-innovation.com/ai-summer-lab). This program entails a two week crash course in machine learning and a two week project development phase for members of the lab. 

## About the Project

Given that the program has a fundamental principle of social good, the idea for this project percolated from an interest in promoting sustainability. **More to add when more is developed**
